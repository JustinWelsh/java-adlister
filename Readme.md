Javabeans Exercise
===================
Create a branch named "javabeans" off of the
"jsp-and-jstl-solution" tag to complete the following:

1. Referring back to the MySQL Tables lesson, create a bean, Album, for the albums table.

2. Referring back to the Database Design lesson, create beans for the quotes and authors tables (Quote and Author). Instead of including a foreign key property in the Quote class, include an Author property.

3. Create a class, BeanTest, and include a main method that instantiates a few instances of Album, Author and Quote.

4. In BeanTest, experiment with storing multiple instances of Quote in an arraylist and iterating over it to print out the content and author name of multiple quotes.

1. Lock down your profile page
    -Ensure that users can only visit the /profile page if they are logged in
    -In your LoginServlet, when a user successfully logs in, set a key named "user" in the session
    -Use this key to redirect unauthorized users that try to visit the /profile page
    -If a user is already logged in and they visit /login, instead redirect them to their profile page

2. Allow users to logout

    When a user visits /logout, they should be logged out of your application and redirected to the login page.

3. Add a message on your profile page that welcomes the currently logged in user
